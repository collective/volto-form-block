Using the engine of subblocks, you can manage form fields adding, sorting and deleting items.

For each field, you can select the field type from:

- Text
- Textarea
- Select
- Single choice (radio buttons)
- Multiple choice (checkbox buttons)
- Checkbox
- Date picker
- File upload with DnD
- E-mail
- Static rich text (not a fillable field, just text to display between other fields)

For every field you can set a label and a help text.
For select, radio and checkbox fields, you can select a list of values.

## Captcha verification

This form addon is configured to work with [HCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com), [ReCaptcha](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/) and
[NoRobot](https://github.com/collective/collective.z3cform.norobots) to prevent spam.

In order to make one of these integrations work, you need to add
[https://github.com/plone/plone.formwidget.hcaptcha](https://github.com/plone/plone.formwidget.hcaptcha) and/or
[https://github.com/plone/plone.formwidget.recaptcha](https://github.com/plone/plone.formwidget.recaptcha) and/or
[https://github.com/collective/collective.z3cform.norobots](https://github.com/collective/collective.z3cform.norobots)
Plone addon and configure public and private keys in controlpanels.

### HCaptcha

With HCaptcha integration, you also have an additional option in the sidebar in 'Captcha provider' to enable or disable the invisible captcha (see implications [here](https://docs.hcaptcha.com/faq#do-i-need-to-display-anything-on-the-page-when-using-hcaptcha-in-invisible-mode)).

In some test scenarios it's found that the "Passing Threshold" of HCaptcha must be configured as "Auto" to get the best results. In some test cases if one sets the Threshold to "Moderate" HCaptcha starts to fail.

### OTP email validation

To prevent sending spam emails to users via the email address configured as sender, the 'email' fields type flagged as BCC will require the user to enter an OTP code received at the address entered in the field when user fills out the form.

## Export

With backend support, you can store data submitted from the form.
In Edit, you can export and clear stored data from the sidebar.

## Additional fields

In addition to the fields described above, you can add any field you want.
If you need a field that is not supported, PRs are always welcome, but if you have to use a custom field tailored on your project needs, then you can add additional custom fields.

```jsx
config.blocks.blocksConfig.form.additionalFields.push({
  id: 'field type id',
  label:
    intl.formatMessage(messages.customFieldLabel) ||
    'Label for field type select, translation obj or string',
  component: MyCustomWidget,
  isValid: (formData, name) => true,
});
```

The widget component should have the following firm:

```js
({
  id,
  name,
  title,
  description,
  required,
  onChange,
  value,
  isDisabled,
  invalid,
}) => ReactElement;
```

You should also pass a function to validate your field's data.
The `isValid` function accepts `formData` (the whole form data) and the name of the field, thus you can access to your fields' data as `formData[name]` but you also have access to other fields.

`isValid` has the firm:

```js
(formData, name) => boolean;
```

Example custom field [here](https://gist.github.com/nzambello/30949078616328e6ee0293e5b302bb40).

## Static fields

In backend integration, you can add in block data an object called `static_fields` and the form block will show those in form view as readonly and will aggregate those with user compiled data.

i.e.: aggregated data from user federated authentication:

![Static fields](./docs/form-static-fields.png)

## Schema validators

If you want to validate configuration field (for example, testing if 'From email' is an address of a specific domain), you could add your validation functions to block config:

```js
config.blocks.blocksConfig.form = {
  ...config.blocks.blocksConfig.form,
  schemaValidators: {
    fieldname: yourValidationFN(data),
  },
};
```

`yourValidationFN` have to return:

- null if field is valid
- a string with the error message if field is invalid.
